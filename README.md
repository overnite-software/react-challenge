# Applicant Project Requirements

Thanks for your interest in OverNite Software. This list of requirements if for prospective candidates as a take home project. We do this in lieu of whiteboards, coding tests and other timed tests as we believe they are not the best gauge of what a developer can do. We provide you with this list of requirements and a simple mockup. You have one week to submit us a public repo. The code you produce and submit is for your own use.

# Requirements

- Must be a React app written by you using create-react-app or whatever bootstrap tool you prefer. You can pull code from your own work or other resources (Stack Overflow)
- Your application needs to pull from either the Github GraphQL or REST APIs
  - https://developer.github.com/v4/
  - https://developer.github.com/v3/
- Must be able to access a profile from the Github API and display the following information:
  - Username
  - Bio (hide is not present)
  - Avatar (display as an image)
  - List of repositories in a list format

# Nice to have features

- Ability to search by user name for a profile by including a text input
- Design the page using a CSS framework of your choosing (Please donâ€™t invest a lot of time worrying about styling)
- Demonstrate some basic crud functionality by being able to remove repositories from the list. You only need to remove them from state, no remote calls are necessary.
- Any sort of testing

When you finish just let us know the public repo URL and we'll pull and test on our end.
